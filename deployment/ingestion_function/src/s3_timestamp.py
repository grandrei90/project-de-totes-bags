"""
This module contains a function for retrieving a timestamp from an S3 object.

The primary purpose of this module is to provide a utility function
that retrieves a timestamp stored in an S3 object. The function,
`get_s3_timestamp`, connects to an S3 bucket, retrieves the
specified object (filename), and returns its content as a timestamp string.

Usage:
1. Ensure the necessary library (boto3) is available.
2. Use the `get_s3_timestamp` function to retrieve a timestamp from
an S3 object.
   - Pass the filename (S3 object key) as an argument.
   - The function connects to the specified S3 bucket and retrieves
   the content of the object.
   - If the object is missing, a default timestamp ('1901-01-01 01:01:01.001')
   is returned.
   - The function raises a TypeError if the input argument is incorrect.

Example:
Assuming an S3 object named 'postgres-datetime.txt' contains a timestamp,
the following usage retrieves it: timestamp = get_s3_timestamp
("postgres-datetime.txt")

    Retrieve a timestamp from an S3 object.
